    <h2>Business Showcase</h2>
    <p>
      Alongside my studies, I manage small businesses that reflect my entrepreneurial mindset 
      and ability to balance academic and professional responsibilities.

      <h3>Tool & Equipment Rental</h3>
      <p>
        I run a small rental service providing construction tools and cleaning equipment. 
        This includes cement mixers, compactors for driveways, carpet cleaning machines, 
        and various construction tools. This activity allows me to support both individuals 
        and local businesses with the right equipment for their projects.

      <h3>Summer Construction Projects</h3>
      <p>
        During the summer, I lead small construction projects focused mainly on 
        driveway renovations and related improvements. 
        Managing these projects has given me valuable experience in planning, 
        teamwork, and delivering results for clients.
