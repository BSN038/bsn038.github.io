# Personal Website — José Castro Castillo

This is my personal website created as part of the Web Development assessment at the University of Salford.  
It demonstrates HTML5, CSS3, and basic web design principles introduced in Week 3, applied to a personal profile and a case study restaurant brand (Best Krazy Chicken).

## 🛠️ Development Process

- The initial HTML framework was created by me using knowledge gained during my first year of Software Engineering at Edge Hill University.
- Now in my second year at the University of Salford, I am revisiting and improving this work with better structure, styling, and branding.
- The project includes six connected pages, consistent navigation, and a business case study for Best Krazy Chicken.
- This is an ongoing project, and I will continue refining it as I progress through upcoming seminars.

## 📘 AI Usage Statement

I used OpenAI’s ChatGPT as a support tool during development.

- It helped me identify improvements in the HTML structure and CSS organisation.
- It suggested ways to make the design more consistent and professional.
- It provided ideas for branding (e.g., BKC logo and profile photo adjustments).

All content was reviewed, adapted, and finalised by me.  
The project reflects my own understanding, combining experience from my first year at Edge Hill with current learning at Salford.

## 🧠 Code Review and Improvements

During development, various **code refinement tools** were used to:

- Improve code readability and professional commenting.
- Ensure WCAG and W3C HTML/CSS compliance.
- Simplify and optimize the JavaScript animation logic.
- Standardize file organization, indentation, and semantics.

The code has been **validated** using:

- [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) for JavaScript linting.

## ✅ Validation & Testing

All HTML pages were tested and validated using the official **W3C Markup Validation Service**:

- **Validator:** [https://validator.w3.org/](https://validator.w3.org/)
- **Result:** No errors or warnings were found on any page.
- **Validation proof:** Confirmed for [https://bsn038.github.io/](https://bsn038.github.io/)

### Accessibility & Structure Improvements

- Added semantic HTML5 elements (`<main>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`).
- Used proper heading hierarchy (`<h1>`–`<h3>`).
- Updated `<address>` placement for valid context.
- Included ARIA attributes for better navigation (`aria-current="page"`).
- All images have descriptive `alt` text for accessibility.

**Outcome:**  
The final version of the website passes all HTML validation tests with no warnings and follows accessibility best practices.

## 🧪 Validation & Mobile Testing

All project files were validated and tested to ensure quality and accessibility.

### ✅ HTML & CSS Validation

- **HTML** pages were validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).
- **CSS** was validated using the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
- Both returned _no critical errors_ and only minor best-practice suggestions.

### 📱 Responsive & Cross-Device Testing

- The website was tested using **Chrome DevTools (Device Toolbar)** across multiple simulated devices such as iPhone SE, iPad, and Pixel 7.
- Layout and typography adapt correctly to smaller screens.
- Navigation links and buttons remain easy to tap and accessible.
- Additional live testing was performed on a real mobile phone to confirm full responsiveness and proper scaling.

### ⚙️ Accessibility & Usability

- Semantic HTML elements are used throughout the site (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`).
- `aria-current` and descriptive alt text were applied for improved screen-reader support.
- The design avoids motion for users with “prefers-reduced-motion” enabled.

## 🏁 Final Summary

This project demonstrates the integration of web development, design principles, and business-focused problem solving.  
Each page was built using clean, semantic **HTML5**, organized **CSS3**, and lightweight **JavaScript (ES6+)** for interactive effects such as animated branding.

The website highlights key skills, business experience, and a real-world case study — all presented through a responsive and accessible layout.  
It was tested across multiple devices, validated using W3C tools, and structured following professional web development standards.

Through this process, I improved my understanding of **responsive design**, **accessibility best practices**, and **front-end optimization** while ensuring a consistent and modern user experience.
