🤖 Generative AI Usage Statement

(Preserved exactly as you requested.)

I used ChatGPT (OpenAI) as a personal learning partner and technical assistant throughout this project. It helped me understand web technologies, debug errors efficiently, and implement advanced features such as the BKC AI Assistant and Netlify serverless functions.

Before adding new components, I discussed the idea with my lecturer, Ms. Kate Han, who approved the extension as part of advanced experimentation within the same assessment scope. Together with ChatGPT, I successfully created additional files like ask.js and site.json, ensuring full academic transparency and independent implementation.
