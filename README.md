## **Project Overview**
This website was developed as part of the Web Application Development assessment.  
It represents the digital presence of **Best Krazy Chicken (BKC)** — a conceptual restaurant brand designed to showcase technical and creative web development skills.  

The goal was to create a **fully responsive**, **accessible**, and **brand-consistent** website that integrates front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) following professional standards and modern web practices.

## **Key Features**
- Responsive, mobile-first layout using CSS Grid and flexible containers.  
- Consistent typography and clear color contrast for readability.  
- Accordion-style restaurant menu to enhance usability and reduce scrolling.  
- Simulated payment box for credit card checkout (Problem-Solving section).  
- Optimized images and subtle watermark integration (BKC logo + UK flag).  
- Use of `<script defer>` for faster load performance.  
- Metadata and JSON-LD (Schema.org Restaurant) for SEO and discoverability.  
- Accessible focus states and semantic structure (H1–H3 consistency).  
- Validation of both HTML and CSS with **no errors** (W3C standards).

## **Design Choices**
The website follows a **clean and structured design**, with a warm green palette inspired by the brand’s pistachio color.  
Soft contrasts and rounded buttons maintain a friendly, professional atmosphere suitable for a restaurant.  
All pages share a unified header and navigation bar for consistency, while the layout adapts fluidly to different devices using responsive grid structures.  
The design prioritizes accessibility, readability, and a natural user flow.

## **Technical Summary**
- **HTML5:** Semantic markup structure and accessibility tags.  
- **CSS3:** Custom variables, responsive grid, and media queries.  
- **JavaScript (ES6):** Interactive elements including the accordion menu and form enhancements.  
- **Form Handling:** Implemented via Formspree (no backend required).  
- **Deployment:** Hosted on **Vercel**, integrated with GitHub for version control.  

---

## **Validation Results**
- **HTML:** 100% valid — No errors or warnings (checked with [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)).  
- **CSS:** 100% valid — No errors; only informational warnings for modern CSS variables.  
  These warnings are caused by dynamic properties that the validator cannot statically interpret.  
  They do **not affect performance, accessibility, or compliance** and are accepted as best practice in modern development.

## **Generative AI Usage Statement**
I used **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** as a learning and support tool during development.  
It helped me with:  
- Improving the structure and organization of CSS and HTML files.  
- Understanding the role of `<script defer>` and JSON-LD for performance and SEO.  
- Debugging JavaScript logic and accessibility focus states.  
- Interpreting validator feedback safely without altering design outcomes.  
- Refining documentation and written English for professional clarity.  

All final implementation decisions, code integrations, and design refinements were made independently.

## **Reflection and Conclusion**
This project successfully demonstrates the ability to combine **technical proficiency** with **creative design** in a real-world business context.  
Throughout the process, I focused on building a site that is **functional, accessible, and visually consistent**.  
Key learning outcomes include mastering responsive layout design, accessibility compliance, and performance optimization.  

By completing the validation, deployment, and documentation process, this project meets the professional and academic standards expected for a prototype deliverable.
