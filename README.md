# Personal Website — José Castro Castillo

This is my personal website created as part of the Web Development assessment at the University of Salford.  
It demonstrates HTML5, CSS3, and basic web design principles introduced in Week 3, applied to a personal profile and a case study restaurant brand (Best Krazy Chicken).

## 🛠️ Development Process

- The initial HTML framework was created by me using knowledge gained during my first year of Software Engineering at Edge Hill University.
- Now in my second year at the University of Salford, I am revisiting and improving this work with better structure, styling, and branding.
- The project includes six connected pages, consistent navigation, and a business case study for Best Krazy Chicken.
- This is an ongoing project, and I will continue refining it as I progress through upcoming seminars.

## 📘 AI Usage Statement

I used OpenAI’s ChatGPT as a support tool during development.

- It helped me identify improvements in the HTML structure and CSS organisation.
- It suggested ways to make the design more consistent and professional.
- It provided ideas for branding (e.g., BKC logo and profile photo adjustments).

All content was reviewed, adapted, and finalised by me.  
The project reflects my own understanding, combining experience from my first year at Edge Hill with current learning at Salford.
