    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently studying <strong>Business Information Technology</strong> at the University of Salford.
      With my background as a self-employed business owner and manager, I realized the importance of
      keeping up to date with new technologies to continue growing professionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to apply modern IT solutions to create new business opportunities
      or implement them in a larger organization.
      Achieving a degree in this country also represents a personal milestone for me,
      as it is the result of overcoming many obstacles on my journey to get here.
